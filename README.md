# Dual-k-space-and-image-space-correction-for-MRI-images-acquired-with-instability-and-inhomogeneity

% purpose   : correct artifacts due to magnetic field instability and inhomogeneity   
% input     : two complex MRI images acquired with inverted read gradient
% output    : corrected image, intermediate corrected images, phase correction and estimated magnetic field inhomogeneity

The method allows 3 different modalities:

0) Instability correction.
1) Inhomogeneity correction.
2) Full correction (instability and inhomogeneity).


- The modality "0" requieres as input a complex MRI image.
- The modality "1" requieres as input 2 MRI images acquired with inverted read gradients (the data for this case can be complex or real).
- The modality "2" requieres as input 2 complex MRI images acquired with inverted read gradients.


- run_full_correction_main.m

This script contains all the functions involved in the correction method.


- correction_prepare_parameters(fsn)

In this function you need to specify the correction modality and other parameters that can be configurated for the correction.


- correction_prepare_get_data

In this function you need to specify the folder and name of the image/images that will be used for the correction.
The program read .m files.
